### README for Tic Tac Toe Game

# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple, interactive Tic Tac Toe game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project allows two players to take turns and compete in the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. 

---

## Features
- **Two-Player Mode**: Players alternate between "X" and "O".
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically detects winning patterns and displays the winner.
- **Reset and New Game Buttons**: Players can reset the current game or start a new one.
- **Dynamic Interface**: The UI updates dynamically based on player actions.
- **Responsive Design**: Works across various screen sizes.

---

## Game Rules
1. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns placing their symbols ("X" or "O") in empty squares.
3. The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
4. If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

---

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the game board and controls.
- **CSS**: Styling and responsiveness of the UI.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, turn handling, and winner detection.

---

## How to Play
1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. Player 1 (O) starts the game by clicking on an empty square.
3. Player 2 (X) takes their turn next.
4. Continue alternating turns until:
   - One player wins by aligning three symbols.
   - The game ends in a draw if the grid is filled without a winner.
5. Use the **Reset** button to clear the board and play again, or the **New Game** button to start a fresh session.
